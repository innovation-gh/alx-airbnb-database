This repository is part of the ALX Airbnb Database Module, focusing on advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques. Within this module, we delve into complex SQL scripts, indexing, partitioning, and performance tuning to handle large datasets efficiently.

The `databaseadvscript` directory specifically houses solutions for implementing these advanced concepts, starting with complex join queries.

 1. Project Overview

This project aims to equip professional developers with practical, handson experience in advanced database management. We simulate an Airbnb database to tackle realworld challenges such as optimizing query performance, designing efficient schemas, and handling scalability for highvolume applications.



 2. Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants will be able to:

   Master Advanced SQL: Write sophisticated queries using joins, subqueries, and aggregations for indepth data retrieval and analysis.
   Optimize Query Performance: Analyze and refactor SQL scripts using performance tools like `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE`.
   Implement Indexing and Partitioning: Apply indexing and table partitioning strategies to enhance database performance for large datasets.
   Monitor and Refine Performance: Continuously monitor database health and propose/implement schema and query refinements.
   Think Like a DBA: Develop datadriven decisionmaking skills for schema design and optimization in highperformance environments.

 4. Task 0: Complex Queries with Joins

Objective: To demonstrate mastery of SQL joins by writing complex queries using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` (or its equivalent).

File: `joins_queries.sql`

This file contains the SQL queries addressing the following requirements:

1.  `INNER JOIN`: Retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings. This query shows only records where there's a match in both `bookings` and `users` tables.
2.  `LEFT JOIN`: Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews. This query returns all properties, with matching review data if available, otherwise `NULL` for review columns.
3.  `FULL OUTER JOIN`: Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.
       Note: For MySQL users, a `FULL OUTER JOIN` is emulated using a `UNION ALL` of a `LEFT JOIN` and a `RIGHT JOIN`. The SQL script provides this emulation for broader compatibility.



 5. Setup and Usage

To use the queries in this repository:

1.  Clone the Repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/innovationgh/alxairbnbdatabase.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the Directory:
    ```bash
    cd alxairbnbdatabase/databaseadvscript
    ```
3.  Database Connection: Ensure you have a running SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and a schema that resembles the Airbnb database structure (tables like `users`, `properties`, `bookings`, `reviews` with appropriate primary and foreign keys).
4.  Execute Queries: Connect to your database using a client tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, `psql` command line) and run the SQL statements from `joins_queries.sql`.
